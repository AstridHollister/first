 I learned about Codesters and writing my own python code. 
 
 I explored making sprites and stages do things with code.
 
 Next week, I want to understand java and python better and be able to write my own code for things like games and sequences.
 
 Next week, my goals are to undertand code better and start making cool stuff on my own, so pretty much the same thing.
